Not a part of CCNA syllabus, but in this lab I covered Voice VLANs. 

It also tested my previous knowledge of Router On A Stick Configuration and Switchport Access and Trunk ports.

All the necessary screenshots are attached in the PDF. 

Key observation while transferring data and voice packets and monitoring them in simulation mode -

The voice traffic from PH2 to PH1 was tagged in the VLAN ID (20 here), but the data traffic was untagged.
