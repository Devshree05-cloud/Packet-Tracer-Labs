This lab is my first step towards the security principles of networks.

I tried the following things and the lab worked successfully:

1. Configured OSPF protocol between the routers.

2. Applied the following conditions:

Configure standard numbered ACLs on R1 and standard named ACLs on R2 such that – 

(a)Only PC1 and PC3 can access 192.168.1.0/24 

(b)Hosts in 172.16.2.0/24 can’t access 192.168.2.0/24

(c)172.16.1.0/24 can’t access 172.16.2.0/24

(d)172.16.2.0/24 can’t access 172.16.1.0/24 

Screenshots of the CLI commands and the command prompts of end hosts are attached properly in the pdf.
