In this lab I practiced the Spanning Tree Protocols and followed the following instructions:

1. Use the CLI to check the current STP topology.  What is the current root bridge?
   
    What is the STP role/state of each port on each switch?

2. Configure SW1 as the primary root for VLAN1 and the secondary root for VLAN2.
   
    Configure SW2 and the primary root for VLAN2 and the secondary root for VLAN1.
   
    What is the STP role/state of each port on each switch now?

3. Increase the VLAN1 cost of SW4's F0/2 interface to 100.
   
    Does SW4 select a different root port?  Why/why not?

4. Increase the VLAN1 port priority of SW1's F0/1 to 240.
   
    Does SW3 select a different root port?  Why/why not?

5. Configure PortFast and BPDU Guard on the F0/3 interfaces of SW3/SW4.

CLI codes and answers to the above questions are in the pdf uploaded.
