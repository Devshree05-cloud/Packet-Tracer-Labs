I used the logic to make variable length subnets in this lab and configured appropriate ip's. 

After configuring complementary ip's to the specific interfaces of routers, I checked the configuration using "do sh ip int br" command. 

I have uploaded the pdf of my handwritten solution to demonstrate my understanding for subnetting. 

When the ip addresses were properly configured, I used the "ip route" command to configure static routes for communication. 

Then I used the ping command on PC1 to send the messages to PC2, PC3 and PC4 and it worked correctly. 

Please do review my "Rough" pdf.
