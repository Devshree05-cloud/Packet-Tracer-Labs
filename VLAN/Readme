Instructions and actions: 

Configure the switch interfaces connected to PCs as access ports in the correct VLAN.

First, I checked that the default gateways, IP addresses and subnet masks were given properly to the pc’s.

And then used "switchport mode access" "switchport access vlan [vlan number]"

Configure the connection between SW1 and SW2 as a trunk, allowing only the necessary VLANs.

"switchport mode trunk" (no encapsulation dot1q detail was needed), "switchport trunk allowed vlan [vlan numbers]"

Configure an unused VLAN as the native VLAN.

"switchport trunk native vlan 1001"

At Switch 2, when we introduce 10 and 30 as trunk ports, it recognises 10 because it is directly connected to it and mentioned in the access port. So, just create a VLAN 30 there too with a simple command. 

"vlan 30"

Configure the connection between SW2 and R1 using 'router on a stick'. 

First I used the "no shutdown" on the g0/0 interface of R1. And then divided it into three subinterfaces, one for each vlan.

"int g/0.10
encapsulation dot1q 10 (vlan)
ip address 10.0.0.62 255.255.255.192"

Tried to ping. Didn’t work, mistake – I forgot to assign the VLANs at the g0/2 interface of SW2. (Using trunk mode)

I used "switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30" on the g0/2 interface of SW2.

Lab is working well now. All PCs can ping each other.
